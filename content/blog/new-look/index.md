*Bismillāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm*

So, I haven't really been actively posting for quite a while despite having a functional site up and I *was* blaming that on things such as not yet implementing my own design as well as not yet sorting out the domain routing issue however now I have implemented the redesign (not done as I'm writing this but will be once you read this), so that's one obstacle out of the way.

The next step is to sort out the routing which will almost certainly be done by the time you read this. Anyways, enough babbling on about logistic stuff. The next **real** step is to start becoming an active blogposter and at this stage, I'll probably still be following on with my plans mentioned in the previous post.
