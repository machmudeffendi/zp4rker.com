*Bismillāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm*

Here is a guide on how I intend to transliterate Arabic to English throughout all posts in my blog and elsewhere *in shā allāh*.

| Letters |
| :-: |
| `ب -> b` |
| `ت -> t` |
| `ث -> th` |
| `ج -> j` |
| `ح -> ḥ` |
| `خ -> kh` |
| `د -> d` |
| `ذ -> dh` |
| `ر -> r` |
| `ز -> z` |
| `س -> s` |
| `ش -> sh` |
| `ص -> ṣ` |
| `ض -> ḍ` |
| `ط -> ṭ` |
| `ظ -> ẓ` |
| `ع -> '` (always when it has a vowel and after a preceding vowel if sākinah) |
| `غ -> gh` |
| `ف -> f` |
| `ق -> q` |
| `ك -> k` |
| `ل -> l` |
| `م -> m` |
| `ن -> n` |
| `ه -> h` |
| `و -> w` |
| `ي -> y` |
| `ء -> -` (if preceded by a vowel or after vowel of previous letter if sākinah) |

| Ḥarakāt |
| :-: |
| `fatḥah -> a` |
| `fatḥah elongated -> ā` |
| `ḍammah -> u` |
| `ḍammah elongated -> ū` |
| `kasrah -> i` |
| `kasrah elongated -> ī` |

(These tables will look a bit better once I implement my design and/or replace it with images *in shā allāh*.)


##### Other notes
- ال (as a definite article) will always be written as *al-* regardless of if the *lām* is pronounced
- Letters with a *sukūn* may be followed by a `-` if combined with the following letter could depict a letter for example *dāl* (d) and *hā* (h) becoming *dhāl* (dh)
- With transliteration of multiple words, the trailing *ḥarakah* of each word may be dropped with the exception of some common phrases/words and possibly other exceptions (pronouns, etc.)
  - In the following example, the *ḥarakah* of the first word is kept and whereas for the second word it is dropped: *al-ḥamdu lillāh*
- Some words in common phrases may be merged into single words for example: *bismillāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm*
  - Technically it should be: *bism allāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm* however due to the nature of the phrase, the first two words are combined
- Transliterated text/excerpts will be in italics to distinguish with regular English text
